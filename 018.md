A fellow contractor, with great connections, just got fired in the middle of the
night.  I feel the ground shaking beneath me.  Supporting my family is one of my
primary concerns, so I need to address this today.  Let's not be rash.  Let's
not scare the family with worry.  Let's just get on it and get some irons in the
fire.
