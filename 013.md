# Review

Yesterday was a good day.  My composure slipped a tiny bit, may have complained
a bit.  Aside from that handled curveballs well.  Good family time and
connections.  I handled myself well with people outside the family.  Still a bit
too jokey, but improving.  Handled rough conversation with my wife well.

Today I'm running on fumes.  Still trying to get this stuff done, but very
little energy.  (Up at 0315 for travel)  I'm still prioritizing these over work,
though.

Back at the airport.  Really long day.  Chat with guy at work pretty good.  The
lesson is don't freak out.  I catastrophize a lot.  Sure glad I didn't share
(dump) my fears on my wife.

Also getting some responses from people.  Asking questions and focusing on them
leads to really good replies.  I also saw an old man in a wheelchair being
endlessly degraded by TSA.  I went to his caretaker and told her it was terrible
and apologized that they had to go through such disrespect.  It seemed to be
some comfort to her, at least knowing they had an ally.

I've got a lot of time to kill, so I may try and be productive again.  I'm
tired, though.  It's obvious what a factor rest is once you've gone back to
sleeping well - then broken it.
