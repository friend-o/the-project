# Review

I did not meditate.  I did not do a gratitude list.  I got a little short with
my wife last night.  Aside from that, I did well studying,  I did trail off at
the end of the day though.

I lose it toward the end.  Front-load the important things.  Later I won't have
the energy.

# Today

Write a little email to my friend.

Meditate for 10.

10 minute gratitude list.

Don't procrastinate.  Do it now.

Oh, hey.  30 minutes later and I've done two already.  I'll save the meditation
for midday when I need it.  It's obviously important to do the imporant stuff
first.
