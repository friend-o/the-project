I'm stalling again.  Let's just start.

Life is a bit off right now.  I have no friends. I'm weak and getting fat.  I'm
drinking a lot.  I'm getting older and it's starting to show.  Little savings.
Good paying job that bores me to tears.  Constantly wasting money.  Marriage is
touch and go.  Family doesn't respect me.  Extreme stress levels.  Broken hand
from loss of temper.  No hobbies.  Etc.

Basically, I'm just drifting hoping things don't suck so bad tomorrow.  I'm
trying to get _through_ each day rather than living it.

I'll fixate on certain areas - making friends, getting fit, respect - and
neglect the rest.  This is why I make good money and most of the rest has fallen
to shambles.

No more excuses.  I need to be a force in life.  This is a game and I need to
play it rather than observing and complaining.  So here we are.

I'm documenting this project and making it public for two reasons:  for the
mental commitment to myself, instead of just day dreaming;  to share.  I'm sure
I'm not the only man with these issues.  Maybe this will help another.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I over analyze as a way of procrastination.  Avoid that from now on.  Action is
the keyword.

I am extremely cynical and negative.  From now on, avoid complaining.  It adds
nothing to the universe.  I suppose insecurity leads to the fear that people
will think I'm ignorant, so I have to proclaim when things are wrong.  Like this
gives me credibility for recognizing problems.  Stop that.  Focus on solutions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I jumped right in, so now I should explain what I'm doing.  I am going to
document the next year, candidly, for this project improving my life.

I don't know exactly what I'm doing, but that's fine.  Let's just start.
