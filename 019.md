Let's refocus.  Like meditating, things just get carried away.  That's OK.  Just
bring it back.

I am anxious about work.  Will I get fired out of the blue?  Maybe.  Should I
stay up all night working and get on early and skip lunch to ingratiate myself?
No.  If I get fired, I will find another job.  Don't worry about it until it
happens.  Don't start working in a way I don't want to work either.  If this
place requires bullshit I don't want to do, I'll find another job.  There's no
fear.

The important things remain the same.  I need to continue working on those.

insurance

These are what I want to work on today.  I'm tempted to add more, but I've been
not finishing my lists recently.  Back to baby steps.  What actions will I take?

Hand
  coordinate appointment with OT
    check email for OT
    forward message from Dr
    If there is no response by lunch, call them again.

Marriage
  search for ideas to make her feel special
  pick one, do it
    Create love notes for her with my son while she's out.  Give them to her
    with a shoulder rub.  While I rub her shoulders, tell her how much she means
    to me and how I'm actively looking for ways to improve our bond.

Insurance
  finish application
    get SSNs from my wife
