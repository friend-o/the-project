I'm so irritable this morning.  It's probably because I stayed up too late, but
it doesn't matter.  I should use it as an opportunity to practice dealing with
emotions.  Instead of trying to not be irritated, how do we manage it?

I faced the irritability and really paid attention to it.  Acknowledging it and
realizing it may affect my perception.  Things have now calmed down and it's
actually pretty nice.  Just remember to pay attention and let things pass.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do today.  My wife and I came up with a plan
together.  It's just time-filling, though.  What am I going to do to move toward
my goals?  Maybe today can be more introspective.

Screw that.  Body first.  I'm going on a run.  If I don't know what to do, I
should fall back to physical health for now.

We went on our little adventure and ended up in a bad McDonald's.  I took charge
and packed everyone up and left.  Didn't really have a plan, but adlibbed.
Turned out really well.
