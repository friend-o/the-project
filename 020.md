I've started using my hand.  Not well, but doing it.  It's helping it to feel
normal again.

My mom emailed me out of the blue.  I'll have to respond at some point.  My wife
has mother issues and I encourage her to work through them.  I'll do the same.

Since this asshole at work showed back up, it's been straining me.  Now I can't
leave work at work and there's this constant stress.  This leaks into life.
It's poisoning the rest of life.  It seems like my gut tells me to leave, but
the coward in my head tells me to stay.  Although work is supposed to be on the
backburner while I figure everything else out, it seems to have come to the
fore.  Also, one thing I'm learning through this project is you can't totally
compartmentalize.

Let's look at it.

Pros and cons?

Why did I start contracting?
flexibility
learn new skills

I have learned no new skills.  I have remote work, but I already had that.  This
is a deadend job.  I am learning nothing except maybe bad habits.  Work does not
need to be the focus of my life, but I need some focus/direction at work.  A
deadend job leads nowhere.  Where is this leading?  A job leads somewhere by
adding skills.  I can _see_ Node here, but it's crap and just a passthrough
layer.  This is not making me a server-side dev.

I have learned a few valuable tricks as far as working in Contract Land, but no
new skills for the resume.  My jobs should be building my resume.  Comfort and
fear are what keep me here.

It's never the right time.  Be bold, though.  I'm not here to lick their feet
and beg for money.  This isn't working for me.  Period.
