Last night we watched a random movie and then went to bed.  I chose the movie
after deflecting for a bit.  It was good.  Not the movie, but choosing and
owning the decision.  We also went to the park with the kids.  I didn't plan
today beforehand as I wanted to go to bed on time.

We woke up and made love after my wife commenting on how great I've been this
week.  Then I went on a 3 mile slow run though I didn't really want to.  I had
one-on-one time with my daughter, including her in the chores I was doing.  And
we came up with a plan for today.

It's just occurred to me that as the leader, I need to usher them to get ready.
I can't just wait for her to do it.

All this to explain that we have a small outing planned for the family and I've
got a task for myself this afternoon regarding work.

# Today

* brainstorm a list of the things I've worked on in the past few years
* update LinkedIn and Toptal (not resume yet, save that for next)

I've also encouraged my wife to go do something for herself.

I'm psyching myself out with the resume and skills.  I need to just go for
action.  The wording doesn't matter.  I am desirable.  They're just scanning
anyway.  It's a numbers game.  I'm going to skip all the brainstorming crap and
just get to updating.

I feel a bit more "normal" than I have recently.  This is probably because I
allowed myself to have an unstructured day.  It wasn't bad.  I called my sister
and comforted her after her dog died.  Feelings-wise, though, I feel normal
again.  I don't like it.  It's undirected.  Let's get back on track.


## Review Today

Good day with some productive action.  I was a decisive leader and helped out
with discipline, comfort, and all that good stuff.  I may have slipped a little
too much back into old feelings and spent time just watching TV and aimlessly
browsing the web.  I complained about a few things, which I should not do.  I
chalk it all up to not being focused today.  I should strive to keep planning.
If I run out of plan, make another.

I'm dithering again.  I'm spending a long time trying to pick the right workout
or barber.  Just pick.
