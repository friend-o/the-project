# Review

I felt less motivated and allowed myself to wander around unstructured.  I could
feel the result afterward, not being as satisfied with the day.  Maybe I was
tired, overstressed, or have not been adding enough enjoyable actions to do each
day.  It was not the best day, but made it work.  Came out and spoke calmly to
my wife after a small argument.  Good practice recovering if nothing else.

I did not plan today.  I listened to a podcast about a guy with terminal cancer,
37, and drank coffee.  Just allowed myself to wake up slowly.  We're getting
back on track now.  I'll try and adjust a bit.

For reviews, I should follow the AAR process.

Work is encroaching on life tonight.  I'm going to attend the meeting, but I'll
make up for it tomorrow.  Gotta keep work in check.

I did have good conversations with my wife and go running with a guy, so that's
good.  I'll save it for the review.

I should buy my homeschooling wife a printer.
