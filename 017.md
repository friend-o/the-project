I fell off the wagon.  Not in an alcoholic way, but in a general sense.  The
last couple days we've been moving.  I'm no longer striving for perfection,
though, so let's get back to it.

# Today

  Find out what is needed of insurance.

  Call ATI and see if I can start PT before getting insurance.

  Call Dr and ask if it's OK that I can't bend my pinky yet.

Arrange to have dryer delivered today.

  Do 3 loads of laundry.

Create budget for the week.

## Growth

  Meditate for 15.

Find a meetup to attend this week.

  Write a short response to friend.

---

This is more of a TODO list than a plan for my day and growth.  Schedule the
priorities, don't prioritize the schedule.

I can't be all or nothing.  I need to do personal growth and chores.  Find the
balance.
