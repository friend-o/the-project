I'm dithering again.  I'm spending a long time trying to pick the right workout
or barber.  Just pick.

Workout, shower, and family time complete.  As much as I want to document this
whole experience for my imaginary readers, I am getting bogged down by
specifics.  I'll stay specific with planning, but it's making my focus too
narrow recounting all the details.

I'll try and mention noteworthy things.

It's occurred to me that part of what I want to change is my image and role.  I
don't want to be childish.  I want to be a respected man.  That doesn't mean
joyless or even always serious.  I just want to work on being a bit more
dignified and being the man I _want_ to be.

My three main roles are:

* Husband
* Father
* Citizen

To be what I want to be in these roles, I need to define the targets.

Husband - Loving, supportive, best friend, protector, comforter, lover,
confidant, leader, inside jokes, respectful, respected, dependable, brings out
the best in my wife, adventurous

Father - Present, dependable, teacher, creative, understanding, compassionate,
listens, role model, provider, safetey net, protector, encouraging, dignified,
playful, good humored, loving, respected, authority, available, wise

Citizen - Strong, polite, aware, dignified, different, responsible, charitable,
successful, independent, influential

These are imperfect - need to stop explaining that constantly, from now on I
will try not to care if people think I made a mistake unknown to me - but they
are a starting point.

I should spend time considering the type of man I want to be.  Reflect on where
I am and how to get to my destination.  These are less actions and more
behaviors.
