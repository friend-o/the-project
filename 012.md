Workout, shower, and family time complete.  As much as I want to document this
whole experience for my imaginary readers, I am getting bogged down by
specifics.  I'll stay specific with planning, but it's making my focus too
narrow recounting all the details.

I'll try and mention noteworthy things.

It's occurred to me that part of what I want to change is my image and role.  I
don't want to be childish.  I want to be a respected man.  That doesn't mean
joyless or even always serious.  I just want to work on being a bit more
dignified and being the man I _want_ to be.

My three main roles are:

* Husband
* Father
* Citizen

To be what I want to be in these roles, I need to define the targets.

Husband - Loving, supportive, best friend, protector, comforter, lover,
confidant, leader, inside jokes, respectful, respected, dependable, brings out
the best in my wife, adventurous

Father - Present, dependable, teacher, creative, understanding, compassionate,
listens, role model, provider, safetey net, protector, encouraging, dignified,
playful, good humored, loving, respected, authority, available, wise

Citizen - Strong, polite, aware, dignified, different, responsible, charitable,
successful, independent, influential

These are imperfect - need to stop explaining that constantly, from now on I
will try not to care if people think I made a mistake unknown to me - but they
are a starting point.

I should spend time considering the type of man I want to be.  Reflect on where
I am and how to get to my destination.  These are less actions and more
behaviors.

Got a curveball.  Wife wants to go on Jamaican vacation in the spring.  I stayed
calm and talked through how I don't think it's a good idea.  We need to create a
budget, start saving, and start saving for a house.  She was defensive, but I
tried to stay calm and focus on keeping talking instead of clamming up.
I tried to agree with her as much as possible while still holding my position.

Now I'm tasked with creating a budget, which she will review, and we will hold
to.

In the interest of staying nimble, using the OODA loop, I'm dropping the hobby
task and replacing it with...

* Create a budget for the upcoming week.

First, we get into the habit of planning before we spend.  Then we start to
change how we spend.

I texted an nice guy I met a while ago to spread some good wishes.  I also moved
our emergency fund into a CD.  I started looking at the will thing and it didn't
seem useful yet.  It only made me realize we need to find Godparents.

I did give my wife a random backrub.
