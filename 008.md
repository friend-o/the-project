Yesterday turned out great.  More amazing sex, family adventures, all around
good.  My wife was a bit off and distant at first, but we talked calmly and
eventually she opened up.  It's easier to mend fences when you feel good.  Since
I've been taking more care of myself, I have more capacity to listen without
becoming defensive.  The thing about being defensive is it happens automatically
when you're attacked.  The aggressor triggers your defensiveness.  If you're
calm and confident, though, you can turn off the natural response and let the
attacks land.  Whether they're fair or not doesn't matter.  When I'm calm and
feel good, my head is straight and I can see this clearly.

As the leader, I need to break the cycle.  The way to do that here is to allow
the gripes and little attacks, absorb them as a man absorbs punches from an
angry child, and work through it.  Is it fair?  No.  Will it get us past the
problem?  Yes.

This morning, I had to fix something at work immediately.  As with the wife, the
annoyances bother me less right now.  Feeling good is a great remedy.  All these
little injustices and annoyances really got to me before.  Now not so much.
I'll keep being thoughtful and hold things in perspective.  I feel like there's
a snowball effect.

Do the things you know you should, even though you don't want to, and things
will start to click.

Diet, sleep, and exercise.

I am drawing a blank trying to plan my day.  I think doing it the prior night is
a good idea.  Having specific goals would help with this.  Maybe that's it.
Create some specific goals.

* Learn to cook a decent meal for the family.

This is random stuff.  I should back up.  Maybe my task should be creating a
goal for this month.  Don't go too big.  Take life a bite at a time.

Today I will:
* -Identify a goal for this month.-
* Do an analysis of my life.
* Say something encouraging to my wife.
* Meditate for 15.
* Review/plan tonight.

I need to do an assessment of my life to figure out the baseline and what to
change.

family
health
career
finances
marriage
social
fun

https://consequenceofbeing.com/2019/02/15/how-to-do-a-life-audit/ seems to have
a good idea.  I'll read it before going off totally on my own.  I have a
tendency to invent every wheel.  Let's try and avoid that.

Don't get stuck or be stubborn.  Adapt plans judiciously.

I'm brainstorming a list of elements of life that are important to me.  To have
and to avoid.  I'm going to use this to do an assessment of my life right now
and quantify what I can.  Then I can use the same periodically to see where I
am.

Wed Sep  4 11:10:42 PDT 2019

That was hard, but I've got my first assessment.  This is a place to start.

My automatic goal is to improve the worst parts of the analysis.  I will use
these to figure out what actions to take each day and do another analysis at the
beginning of next month.

Here are my lowest stats.  They should be my daily priority.

* 1 - ability to be leader of family - 1
* 1 - appearance - 1
* 1 - asking about others - 1
* 1 - budget - 1
* 1 - cynicism - 1
* 1 - family leadership - 1
* 1 - finances - 1
* 1 - friends - 1
* 1 - gratitude - 1
* 1 - hobbies - 1
* 1 - life skills - 1
* 1 - physical health - 1
* 1 - relationships - 1
* 1 - respect of family - 1
* 1 - sense of purpose/meaning - 1
* 1 - sincerity - 1
* 1 - social - 1
* 1 - spare time - 1
* 1 - strength - 1

I don't want to get overwhelmed, so I need to break them into bites.  There are
20, so let's organize them by weekdays and leave the weekend as wildcards.

* 1 - appearance - 1
* 1 - physical health - 1
* 1 - strength - 1

* 1 - sense of purpose/meaning - 1
* 1 - ability to be leader of family - 1
* 1 - family leadership - 1

* 1 - friends - 1
* 1 - social - 1
* 1 - asking about others - 1

* 1 - hobbies - 1
* 1 - life skills - 1
* 1 - spare time - 1

That was awkward, first I grouped them logically.  That helps to reveal some
duplication.

First plant flowers, then pull weeds.

What can I do to power these up?

Oy.  That's half.  Maybe I don't have to do all of this upfront.  I'm over
analyzing.  I'll stop now, knowing at least what to pick from when planning
tonight.

## Review Today

I had quality time with my son and guided him easily and gently out of an
Autistic meltdown.  I made a lot of headway toward a deliberate life.  I've got
a grab bag of traits to work on.  I worked in a few things, but it was all off
script, so it's hard to review.  Overall, I did well today moving the project
forward.

## Tomorrow

Here are specific actions I will take to improve my stats:

* go to run group meetup
  appearance - 1
  physical health - 1
  spare time - 1
  friends - 1
  social - 1

* write as many reasons for gratitude as I can think of in 15 minutes
  gratitude - 1

* cancel dental insurance
  finances - 1

* find a better place to keep the kids' $
  finances - 1

* read 2 articles about being a good father
  ability to be leader of family - 1
