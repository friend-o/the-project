Yesterday turned out great.  More amazing sex, family adventures, all around
good.  My wife was a bit off and distant at first, but we talked calmly and
eventually she opened up.  It's easier to mend fences when you feel good.  Since
I've been taking more care of myself, I have more capacity to listen without
becoming defensive.  The thing about being defensive is it happens automatically
when you're attacked.  The aggressor triggers your defensiveness.  If you're
calm and confident, though, you can turn off the natural response and let the
attacks land.  Whether they're fair or not doesn't matter.  When I'm calm and
feel good, my head is straight and I can see this clearly.

As the leader, I need to break the cycle.  The way to do that here is to allow
the gripes and little attacks, absorb them as a man absorbs punches from an
angry child, and work through it.  Is it fair?  No.  Will it get us past the
problem?  Yes.

This morning, I had to fix something at work immediately.  As with the wife, the
annoyances bother me less right now.  Feeling good is a great remedy.  All these
little injustices and annoyances really got to me before.  Now not so much.
I'll keep being thoughtful and hold things in perspective.  I feel like there's
a snowball effect.

Do the things you know you should, even though you don't want to, and things
will start to click.

Diet, sleep, and exercise.

I am drawing a blank trying to plan my day.  I think doing it the prior night is
a good idea.  Having specific goals would help with this.  Maybe that's it.
Create some specific goals.

* Learn to cook a decent meal for the family.

This is random stuff.  I should back up.  Maybe my task should be creating a
goal for this month.  Don't go too big.  Take life a bite at a time.

Today I will:
* -Identify a goal for this month.-
* Do an analysis of my life.
* Say something encouraging to my wife.
* Meditate for 15.
* Review/plan tonight.

I need to do an assessment of my life to figure out the baseline and what to
change.

family
health
career
finances
marriage
social
fun

https://consequenceofbeing.com/2019/02/15/how-to-do-a-life-audit/ seems to have
a good idea.  I'll read it before going off totally on my own.  I have a
tendency to invent every wheel.  Let's try and avoid that.

Don't get stuck or be stubborn.  Adapt plans judiciously.

I'm brainstorming a list of elements of life that are important to me.  To have
and to avoid.  I'm going to use this to do an assessment of my life right now
and quantify what I can.  Then I can use the same periodically to see where I
am.

That was hard, but I've got my first assessment.  This is a place to start.
