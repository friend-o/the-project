Don't fall into the reaction trap.  IMs waiting for me do not require me to
respond immediately.  Observe Orient Decide Act

Don't skip decide.  Slow down.

Actions aside, I'm going to try and maintain good posture all day.

Stopping to analyze, there's no immediacy.  I read the IMs, but there's no
action to take.  Keep in mind that I am a participant in life.  I'm capable and
really good at what I do.  They've seen that, so I don't need to try and get
into their good graces by being a workaholic busybody.  That's not how I work.
If that's a requirement of the job, I'll find another.  Life is what's
important.  I've focused a lot on work, which is why life is suffering.  Keep
that in mind.  Fight the reactions and habits.

I got distracted setting up transactions for my index fund.  I realize that I
did not plan this.  I've stopped momentarily to decide if I want to do this now.

This finishes up an important task from a few days ago.  It is quick and more
urgent than my other actions for today.  Let's do it.

For now, I have a recurring withdrawl from checking into the index fund.  Once
my settlement fund is set up, use my main bank to push to the brokerage account.

OK, done.  That wasn't too bad.  I had to prevent myself from continuing down
that path.  I will work on finances later.  I have things planned for today.

I was about to write off the "talk to a stranger" action, thinking only of
blockers.  Then I realized the guy next to me is a stranger.  I complimented his
computer case and chatted for 60 seconds.  Start small.

That one was really intimidating.  Good to practice and see that it's no biggie.
