Wow, that was harder than I thought.  Gratitude is things I'm grateful for
existing, not absense.  Grateful I'm not on fire is probably not real gratitude.

Gratitude is the recognition of gifts in life.

Get a will, life insurance.
Give wife a back rub (that doesn't lead to sex).
I'm super unstable.  Just the thought of writing my dad a letter made me well
up.
Daily individual focused time.

As ideas come up, I'm moving them to my list of solutions.  I can choose from
them as I plan new days.  Adding distance between the idea and the execution is
a good practice in being more deliberate.

I sent an email asking how to cancel my dental since we're not in that state anymore.

## Child Accounts

Custodial Account - These are an account I manage in their name.  The money is
not earmarked for college.  Charles Schwab is recommended, no fees, investment
account (stock market).  What others are recommended?  They are also called
brokerage accounts.

There are considerations with tax and giving all the money at a young age.  A
better idea may be to keep our own account and give it to them when they are of
age.

growth stock mutual fund - group of stocks in growing companies
S&P 500 - 500 average, follows the market
mutual fund - actively managed

Index funds are what we want to invest in.
https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-index-funds/ has a good list.  How do I
create accounts for the kids that invest in these?

I need a broker or brokerage account.  The I can instruct them to use the index
fund.

Vanguard looks good for buy and hold.  Good with mutual and index funds.  Can I
choose the index fund?

Vanguard is the one.  An index account will follow S&P500 and grow over the
years.  There are fees for trading, but we aren't trading or actively managed.
I will create one account for them both and split it down the middle when they
come of age.

We're unable to verify your identity You won't be able to submit this request
online. You can still print your completed application and mail it to Vanguard
by reviewing and accepting the consent to electronic delivery of the fund
prospectus.

I made significant headway.  Now I need to make some money.

877 662 7447 - personal investments Vanguard
Why do I have to mail this for to verify my identity?

Thu Sep  5 09:43:37 PDT 2019

Called Vanguard, no need to worry.  Print sign and send paperwork and we should
be in business.

Thu Sep  5 12:46:54 PDT 2019
General: (800) 471-0284
Need to send physical cancellation.

Thu Sep  5 14:54:52 PDT 2019

I guess this is turning into my notepad.  As long as I keep identifying info out
of it, that's OK.  It will further illustrate all the problems and questions
encountered.
