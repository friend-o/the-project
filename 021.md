I told my wife about the craziness that's been happening at work.  She was
thankful that I didn't burden her with it at the time.  The lesson is to not
always share everything.  Be thoughtful.

I've started the ball rolling on getting another job.  I can't sit in the
comfort zone.  That's how you lose.  I need to consider my professional life and
get my thoughts and talking points in order before the call.  I need to know
what I want before talking with others or else I'll be swept along.

# Today

Prepare for call.
  decide what I want
  anticipate a few questions
  prepare diplomatic/professional responses

  I want to work for another client.
  I want to focus on Node.

  How do you explain that the culture is toxic?
  That the tech is bad?

    Desire to gain a new skill or grow a current skill.
    Desire to learn.

The meeting went very well.  It's important to say valuable things that may be
implied.  Make them known.  It's also important to stay positive and
professional.  I started by asking myself what their concerns were and made sure
I went in understanding them.  I also rehearsed my intro to make sure I stayed
positive and got the things out I wanted to say.

My days were numbered anyway.  I can't live scared.  Fear leads to immobility.
Immobility gets you left behind or trampled.  If I'm moving toward something,
things my bump me off course a bit, but I still have my force moving me toward
the goal.  If I'm not moving, any hits will move me wildly.

Side note:  approaching this professionally with their concerns in mind really
impressed them.  Stay cool, stay positive, don't be impetuous.

I have way more patience for the stupid little boy at work now that I know I'm
on my way out.  When I start to get upset, I should look for my project.  The
answer IS within me.
