I'm making some hand progress.  I feel motivated to learn specific Node stuff.
I feel like _not_ doing this.

I should probably keep doing it, though, to make sure I'm being thoughtful.
Following my instincts is pretty good, but it can lead to neglect.  Let's just
keep this easy so it's cheap.

# Today

Meditate for 10.

Read an article on how to be a good father to a young daughter.
  Write a note to my daughter.

Spend 10 minutes thinking up gratitude list.

That's enough for now.  I didn't finish what I wanted yesterday.  Let's keep it
small.
