Still moving, embracing the imperfect.  Not enough sleep, late for work.  I
don't have cash or envelopes for budgetting.  Still, I can take a few to make a
plan.

# Review

I did well throughout the day, stayed positive, adapted to stay on budget, and
even finished a couple tasks.  I didn't finish everything, but I improved a
couple like talking to strangers at the airport.

Creating a plan adds direction.  Sticking to the plan is useful.  It's OK to go
off the plan if it's serving the same goal.

# Today

Pick a meetup for this week.

Read an article about caring for ASD child.

Read an article about manly confidence.

Practice making eye contact and smiling.

I'm going to stop here for now.  Planning can be quick.

# Review

Today went well despite being tired.  Acknowledging that I was tired and
understanding that it would affect my mood was helpful.  I wasn't a tyrant about
my todo list.  I did all the things, but also took advantage of the moment and
dealt with continuing my brokerage account for the index fund where I'm moving
the kids' stuff.  There is value in action.  Don't sweat the imperfect.  Act
within it.
